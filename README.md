#Project for Bootcamp week 2#
This project is a hours recording method for business
*specifically St John Ambulance*
---
The aim of the site/app is to allow members to see
upcoming events and to leave availability for it

The second feature of the app is to allow members
to check in and out of the event

**Currently there is no backend functionality to the app and the JavaScript stylings are very rudimentary, this will be remedied over the coming updates**

Final feature of the app is a way for the user to view their accumulated hours as recorded via the checkin/out page


***Many thanks to all who test and collaborate on this project***
